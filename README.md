# K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation
This project demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their behavioral data. The goal is to group similar customers together, enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved business decisions.

## Overview
K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm widely used for partitioning datasets into distinct groups. In this project, we apply K-Means to customer data (such as purchase frequency, spending score, etc.) to identify unique segments. This analysis helps businesses better understand their customer base and personalize their offerings.

### Main dependencies include:
Numpy

Pandas

The dataset Mall_Customers.csv contains the following columns:
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
Age: Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned to the customer based on their purchasing behavior
